## Instructions
* Ensure you have node.js and npm installed on your system. 
* Cd into the root directory and run 'npm install'
* To run the application, cd into the root directory and enter 'npm start' in your terminal
* To run the test suite, cd into the root directory and enter 'npm run test' in your terminal

## Interacting with the application
* To sort the compounds by either the number of rings, molecular name, or molecular weight, you can click the column header and it will sort them automatically. 
* To search for a particular compound, you can use the search bar and enter the details that are relevant to the compound you're looking for. The table of compounds will be filtered to match your query.
* At the bottom of the landing page, you have a solubility chart that indicates the solubility of each compound. I included it for quick reference when using the app. If you hover over any data point, it will provide you with the details related to the compound. The data points are coloured by the number of rings. 
* To see the assay data, and related details, associated with a compound, simply click the compound name in the data table and you will be taken to the assay details page related to the compound you clicked.

This was a super fun project and I really enjoyed thinking about how to translate this data into meaningful insights!
